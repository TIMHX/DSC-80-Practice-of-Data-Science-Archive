    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook.\n",

    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying python file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",
    "2. The notebook may be graded (if it contains free response questions or asks you to draw plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Labs will have public tests and private tests. The public \"smoke tests\" that you will run below and which appear on Gradescope are generally worth no points. After the due date, we will replace these tests with private tests that will determine your grade. This is different from DSC 10, where labs only had public tests!\n",

    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name.\n",

    "- Notebooks for *projects* will serve as a final report for the assignment, and contain conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",

    "**Tips for developing in the .py file**:\n",
    "- Do not change the function names in the starter code; grading is done using these function names.\n",

    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",
