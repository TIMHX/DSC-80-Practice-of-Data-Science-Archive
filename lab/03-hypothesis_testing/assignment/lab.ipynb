    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding will be done in an accompanying `lab.py` file that is imported into the current notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs and programming assignments will be graded in (at most) two ways:\n",
    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying python file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",
    "2. The notebook may be graded (if it contains free response questions or asks you to draw plots).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Labs will have public tests and private tests. The public \"smoke tests\" that you will run below and which appear on Gradescope are generally worth no points. After the due date, we will replace these tests with private tests that will determine your grade. This is different from DSC 10, where labs only had public tests!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",
    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name.\n",
    "- If you changed something you weren't supposed to, just use git to revert! Ask us if you need help with this, or google around for `git revert`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for working in the Notebook**:\n",
    "- The notebooks serve to present the questions and give you a place to present your results for later review.\n",
    "- The notebook on *lab assignments* are not graded (only the `.py` file).\n",
    "- Notebooks for *projects* will serve as a final report for the assignment, and contain conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",
    "- The notebook serves as a nice environment for 'pre-development' and experimentation before designing your function in your `.py` file. You can write code here, but make sure that all of your real work is in the .py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for developing in the .py file**:\n",
    "- Do not change the function names in the starter code; grading is done using these function names.\n",
    "- Do not change the docstrings in the functions. These are there to tell you if your work is on the right track!\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional helper functions to solve the lab! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",

    "You are analyzing data from a veterinarian clinic. The datasets contain several types of information from the clinic, including its customers (pet owners), pets, and available procedures and history. The column names are self-explanatory. These dataframes are provided to you:\n",
    "-  `owners` stores the customer information, where every `OwnerID` is unique (verify yourself).\n",
    "-  `pets` stores the pet information. Each pet belongs to a customer in `owners`.\n",
    "-  `procedure_detail` contains a catalog of procedures that are offered by the clinic.\n",
    "-  `procedure_history` has procedure records. Each procedure is given to a pet in `pets`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the most popular Procedure Type for all of the pets we have in our `pets` dataset? Note that some pets are registered but haven't had any procedure performed. Also, some pets that have had procedures done, are not registered in `pets`. Create a function `most_popular_procedure` that takes in `pets`, `procedure_history` and returns the name of the most popular Procedure Type as a string.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. What is the name of each customer's pet(s)? Create a function `pet_name_by_owner` that takes in `owners`, `pets` and returns a Series that holds the pet name (as a string) indexed by owner's (first) name. If an owner has multiple pets, the corresponding value should be a list of names as strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each city that had owners who had their pets in our procedure history, how much does the city spend in total on procedures? Create a function `total_cost_per_city` that returns a Series that contains the sum of money that a city has spent on pets' procedures, indexed by `City`. Hint: think of what makes a procedure unique in the context of this dataset."
